# GraphAlgos

## My Graph algorithms project
* Step 2 : Create a Graph drawing library, that you can easily create directed / undirected graphs.
and maybe even bipartite graph.

* Step 2 : Add viable way to draw existing graph, ( a.k.a to show graphs that were created in algorithms )

* Step 3 : Add some graph algorithms, Algo 1 : the hungarian method, finding max matching in bipartite graph.

## Controls

* Double click on empty space to create Node.
* Select Edge/Node by clicking on them.
* While Edge/Node Selected press D, to removed them.
* While 2 Nodes Selected press E to connected with edge, ( if directed then connetion would be from first select to second selected ).
* Right click to deselect all.


## Algorithm : Hungarian ( Max-matching Bipartite Graphs )
